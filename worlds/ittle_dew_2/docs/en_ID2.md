# Ittle Dew 2

## Where is the Options page?

// TODO Put in a link to the options page

## What does the randomizer do?

Currently, the randomizer shuffles the location of all items in the game, including weapons, keys, cards, and optional goodies.

All chests, keys, and cards can be locations depending on your settings.

Enemy and Entrance Randomizer are planned for later.

## What is the goal?

The randomizer currently has three possible goals:

* Find the eight randomized Raft Pieces throughout the world
* Defeat Simulacrum
* Defeat the Dream Fly

All goals require you to return to the center pond of Fluffy Fields and see the credits to complete your goal after finishing their other prerequisites.
